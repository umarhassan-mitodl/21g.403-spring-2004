Goals of the Course
-------------------

1.  To strengthen your communicative skills in speaking and writing
2.  To improve your receptive skills in listening and reading
3.  To build your vocabulary
4.  To increase your awareness of cultural difference
5.  To improve your analytical and interpretative skills

Vocabulary Acquisition
----------------------

In your note book you will enter the 5-8 items of new vocabulary selected by the class each day, numbered consecutively throughout the semester. It will be collected at regular intervals. For each new word write your own sentence. Memorize each item so that you can use it readily. Don't forget the principal parts of verbs, plural of nouns, etc. There is a complete list of strong verbs in Appendix 4 of the _Handbuch_.

It is highly suggested that you procure a standard hardcover German/English Dictionary (paper-back versions  and web dictionaries do not give enough information on usage).

Compositions
------------

You will be assigned four written compositions. Adhere to the following format: 1-2 pages, typed double-spaced, margin of 1-1 1/2 inches on each side (ca. 350 words). Both content and grammar/style will be graded. Each composition is to be re-worked in a second draft. Each version will be graded. Both content and grammar/style will be graded.

Language Laboratory (= LLARC)
-----------------------------

"Hörverständnis" exercises are assigned regularly (in Section 2 of the _Arbeitsheft_). This material is on cassettes in the LLARC. The _Arbeitsheft_ will be collected at regular intervals. Additional audio and video tapes on contemporary German topics, as well as some of the reading texts will be assigned for the Lab. Lab worksheets and and other worksheets are to be turned in as part of the regular homework and will be corrected and counted as such.

Tests
-----

Four tests will be given during the term, covering readings, vocabulary, grammar and lab materials. There will be no midterm or final.

Note
----

There is a pedagogical reason for the strict and controlled organization of this course: the secret to success in foreign language acquisition lies in **sustained daily effort**, frequent practice, and repetition. Therefore, late homework will not be accepted, including essays, unless you have gotten an extension from the instructor beforehand. If an emergency situation or sleep deprivation should prevent you from preparing for class, please let the instructor know at the beginning of the hour, we'll find a way for you to get the most out of class.
